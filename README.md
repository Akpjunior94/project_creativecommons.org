## Development


### Development dependencies
Make sure you have installed [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and `docker-compose` for your operating system prior to following these instructions.


### Initialize Git submodules

This project consists of several components, such as WordPress themes, that are developed in their own Git repositories. If you have already cloned this project's code, make sure the Git sub-modules are activated by running the following command.

```sh
git submodule update --init
```

Alternatively, you can initialize the submodules when you clone the repository with the following command.

```sh
git clone --recursive
```

## Environment variables

There are several environment variables required to run the `docker-compose` command. Copy the `.env.example` to `.env` and override the variables if needed. The defaults should work fine.

### Changing database

The `.env` file should contain a variable called `DATABASE` that is used to choose which database to use for development (`mysql` or `mariadb`).

If you change the value of the `DATABASE` variable at any time during development, you will need to remove the old database volume in order and rebuild the images to prevent errors.

1. list all Docker volumes to find the relevant volume
    - `docker volume ls`
2. remove the volume
    - `docker volume rm <volume-id>`
3. rebuild the docker image
    - `docker-compose up --build -d`

### Run the development server

Once you have installed the above development dependencies, you can run the following commands from within this project directory.


#### Start the server

```sh
docker-compose up
```

#### Stop the server

```sh
docker-compose down
```


### Access WordPress

After starting the server, you should be able to access WordPress at http://localhost:8080

### Install WordPres (first-time)

If you are starting the WordPress service for the first time, you will see the WordPress installation wizard. Complete the installation process and make note of your username and password so that you can log in (below).


### Log in to WordPress

With the development server running, log in to the local WordPress with the default login credentials.

- username: admin
- password: password

Note: you will need to visit http://localhost:8080/wp-login.php


### Access the WordPress admin area

Once you are logged in with your admin user (above), you can access the WordPress admin area:

- http://localhost:8080/wp-admin/
